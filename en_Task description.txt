An existing function is to be extended.
For this purpose, there is a short description of the changes by a project manager (see below).

The existing function is based on the input files (SupplierData.csv and ProductGroups.csv) and the code (IntelliJ project).
However, you can use a development environment of your choice.
The result is the file Output.csv. 
(...\bewerberaufgabetabelle-master\Bewertungstabelle\resources --> German terms)

The task is to create requirement descriptions from the requirements (new .txt file) and then implement the points in the solution.


Please note that the variables are German terms. You can translate them for your own understanding !!!
This is close to reality, but unfortunately somewhat cumbersome.

Scenario:
Request/ e-mail from the HCM Project Manager:

Hello dear Candidate,

We had a requirement meeting with the client.
The following changes are to be made to our export of supplier ratings:

1. only approved and archived suppliers (German Term: zugelassene und archivierte Lieferanten)
2. please take into account the evaluation categories 4 + 5 as well (German Term:  Bew Kat 4 &  Bew Kat 5)
3. add commodity groups of the suppliers in plain names
4. please arrange the suppliers in the first line next to each other 

Please create a detailed requirements list and implement the changes in the code. If new requirements arise, please also add them to the list.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or if requirements are unclear and 
we have to consult with the customer again. (In this case, the project managers are Mr KÃ¼bler or Mr Schmid).

With kind regards
HCM Project Manager
